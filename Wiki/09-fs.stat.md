# fs.stat(pathToFile, callback):

**fs.stat** is the asynchronous form of **fs.statSync** i.e it does not block the processes inside event loop as it is non-blocking format.

fs.stat also returns the object of `fs.Stats` class and it takes two parameters:

- **pathToFile** : pathToFile is the filename including its complete path. it tells fs.stat to return the stats for the file which is given through it.

- **callback**: it is the function that is called at the end of the processing of the fs.stat function. callback always has two parameters in case of file module, the first parameter is always reserved for error/ exception and the second one is the stats object which is returned by the stat function.

Check this below example to understand fs.stat :

```js
// Example :

// importing required modules
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// defining path of the file , using "konfinity.txt" that we have created in previous articles
let pathToFile = path.join(__dirname, "fs1.js");

// using fs.stat

fs.stat(pathToFile, (error, stats) => {
  if (error) {
    // if any occurs while processing then this block gets executed and terminates the process
    throw error; // throwing the error occured
  }
  console.log(stats); // if no error occured then the stats will get printed.
});
```

```js
// Output of the above code :

Stats {
