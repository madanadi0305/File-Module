# FS Module Exercise 24

Write a Javascript program that deletes a file.

Your task is to create a function that takes one parameter: path to file, which is to be deleted and returns a promise that resolves a message "File deleted successfully", if the file is deleted and rejects "error deleting file", if any error occurs

Hint :

- Open file named: **task24.js** and start coding inside it
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameters
- Use fs.unlink to remove the file.
- return the promise as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
