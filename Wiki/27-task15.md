# FS Module Exercise 15

Write a Javascript program that writes data to a file.

Your task is to create a javascript function that takes two parameters: first is a `filename` with its path and second is `data` that is to be written

Return the promise from the function that resolves the message "Content written to file successfully" when given data is written to a file and rejects the error with the message "Error writing content in file" if any error occurs.

Hint :

- Open file named: **task15.js** and start coding inside it
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameters
- Use fs.writeFile to write the content to the file
- return the promise as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
