# FS Module Exercise 20

Write a Javascript program that append the content to a file.

Your task is to create a function that takes two parameters, first is a file name with its path and second content to be appended, and returns a promise. Import your task04.js and use it inside the function to ensure whether the file exists or not. If the file exists then your function should append the given content to the file and resolves a message "Data appended successfully". and If the file does not exist then it should reject with the message "Cannot append data because : File does not exists".

Hint :

- Open file named: **task20.js** and start coding inside it
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameters
- Use require() to import your **task04**.
- Use fs.appendFile to write the content to the file
- return the promise as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
