# fs.unlink(pathToFile, callback)

This is an asynchronous function is used to delete the file located at a given path including the filename.

It takes two parameters:

- pathToFile : it provides the file name with its path from where this function will remove the
 file with the given name from the given path.

- callback : it is the function that is executed at the completion of the unlink function 
and takes only one parameter which is an error.

Example :

```js
// importing required modules :

const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// defining file name and path from which we have to remove file
// let us remove konfinity.txt
let pathToDir = path.join(__dirname, "konfinity.txt");

// removing file

fs.unlink(pathToDir, error => {
  if (error) {
    // if error occurs while removing file then
    throw error; // throw the error
  } else {
    console.log("File Removed"); // display appropriate message if error doesnot occur
  }
});
```
