# fs.copyFile(sourcePathToFile, destinationPathToFile, callback)

fs.copyFile() is the function that asynchronously copies the data from a source file to the destination file.
This process overwrites the file at the destination if it already exists. if the file is not present at the destination then it creates one file with the specified name.

This function takes three parameters which are as follows :

- sourcePathToFile: This provides the source file name with its path, whose data is to be copied.

- destinationPathToFile: This provides the destination file name with its path, where data is to be copied.

- callback: it is a function that is executed at the end of the processing and it takes only one parameter which is an error.

Let us discuss one example of copying data from one file to another :

```js
// Example

// importing required modules
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// defining path of the source file. Let us use konfinity.txt as the source file

let sourcePathToFile = path.join(__dirname, "konfinity.txt");

// defining path of the Destination file. Let us use KonfinityMoto.txt as the destination file

let destinationPathToFile = path.join(__dirname, "KonfinityMoto.txt");

// calling copy file function

fs.copyFile(sourcePathToFile, destinationPathToFile, error => {
  if (error) {
    // checking whether error occured or not
    throw error; // if error occurs throw it
  } else {
    console.log("File copied"); // else display the appropriate message
  }
});
```
