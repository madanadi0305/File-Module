# FS Module Exercise 17

Write a Javascript program that appends data to a file.

Your task is to create a javascript function that takes two parameters: first is a filename with its path and the second is data that is to be written.

Check if the file exists or not. Return the promise from the function that resolves the message "Content appended to file successfully" when given data is appended to a file if the file exists and if the file does not exist then rejects with the error message "File does not exists provide another name".

Hint :

- Open file named:**task17.js** and start coding inside it
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameters
- Use fs.access to ensure the file exists or not.
- Use fs.readFile to fetch existing data in the file
- Use fs.writeFile to write the content to the file
- return the promise as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
