# FS Module Exercise 18

Write a Javascript program that appends data to a file.

Your task is to create a javascript function that takes two parameters: first is source filename with its path and second is destination filename with its path

Check if the source file exists or not and append the content to the destination file if the destination file exists and if the destination file does not exists then create a file and write the content of the source file to it.

Return the promise from the function that resolves the message "Content written to file successfully" when given data is written to the file and rejects with an error message "Source File does not exists" if an error occurs.

Hint :

- Open file named: **task18.js** and start coding inside it
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameters
- Use fs.access to ensure the file exists or not.
- Use fs.readFile to fetch existing data in the file
- Use fs.writeFile to write the content to the file
- return the promise as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
