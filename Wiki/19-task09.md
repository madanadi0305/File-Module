# FS Module Exercise 9

Write a Javascript program to fetch files from a directory.

Your task is to create a javascript function that takes one parameter i.e. path to directory, traverse that path and count the number of the individual files and directories. If any directory appears in traversing then traverse that also.
you have to count a number of individual files and directories until all the files and directories are counted inside the given directory.

Note: Given Directory will be excluded from the count.

Return a promise which resolves an object containing 2 properties as follows :

- 1st property named: countDir : that contains a count of directories inside a given directory
- 2nd property named: countFile : that contains a count of individual files inside a given directory

and rejects with a message "Error occured while traversing directory", if any error occurs

Hints :

- Open file named **task09.js** and start coding inside it.
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameter.
- Use fs.readdir to fetch files from a directory
- Use the if-else loop and count the individual files and directories.
- return a promise inside the function as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
