# fs.appendFile(pathToFile, data, callback)

fs.appendFile is the function that is used to add the content to the file located at pathToFile asynchronously.
If the file already exists then this function adds the content after the data already present in the file. If the file does not exist at that location then it creates a new file with the given name and at the given path with given content.

it takes 3 parameters :

- pathToFile : it provides the filename with its location to the function to which data is to be appended.

- data : This parameter defines what data is to be added at the file.

- callback : it is a function executed at the end of the processing of the function and takes only one parameter which is an error.

Let us understand this with the below example.

```js
// Example :

// importing required modules
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// defining the path with the filename to which we have to add the data.
// let us use konfinity.txt

let pathToFile = path.join(__dirname, "konfinity.txt");

// using appendFile to append "Happy Coding !" to the konfinity.txt file

fs.appendFile(pathToFile, "Happy Coding !", error => {
  if (error) {
    // if error occurs during appending the file then
    throw error; // throw the error.
  } else {
    console.log("Data appended to the file"); // print the appropriate message if no error occurs.
  }
});
```
