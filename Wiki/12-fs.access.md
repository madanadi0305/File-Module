# fs.access(pathToFile, callback)

fs.access is the function is used to access the file i.e it ensures whether the file exists or not at the path with the given name.

It takes two parameters, the first parameter is pathToFile : it provides the name of the file including the path of the file. The second parameter is callback: callback is the function called at the end of the processing and it takes only one parameter which `error`,

If an error occurs during accessing the file then it means that file does not exist and if no error occurs then file exists.

Refer below example to understand usage of `access()` :

```js
// Example

// importing required modules
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// defining path of the file , using "konfinity.txt" that we have created in previous articles
let pathToFile = path.join(__dirname, "konfinity.txt");

// calling fs.access function with pathToFile as a parameter

fs.access(pathToFile, error => {
  if (error) {
    // checking whether any error occured or not during file access
    console.log("File does not exists"); // if error occured then print this message
    // throw error;  // you can even throw the error to see what error occured
  } else {
    // if no error occured
    console.log("File exists"); // print this message
  }
});

// output : File exists.

// try replacing the name of the file with a different name that doesn't exist and see the output.
