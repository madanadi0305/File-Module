# FS Module Exercise 14

Write a Javascript program that fetches data from a file.

Your task is to create a javascript function that takes one parameter which is a filename with its path and fetch the content of the file (file will be `js` file) and calculate the number of variables and number of functions inside that file. Return the promise from the function that resolves an object that has two properties :

- 1st property named: functionCount : that contains the number of functions in the file
- 2nd property named: variableCount : that contains the number of variables in the file.

rejects the error with message "Error reading file", if any error occurs.

Hint :

- Open file named: **task14.js** and start coding inside it
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameters
- Use fs.readFile to read the content of the file
- Use `let`, `const` and `var` to count the number of variables.
- Use `function` and `arrow` to count the number of functions.
- return the promise as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
