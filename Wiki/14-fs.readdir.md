# fs.readdir(pathToFile, callback)

**fs.readdir** is the function that reads the content of the directory and
 returns the array of the files inside that directory if files exist.

It takes two parameters and they are as follows :

- pathToFile : It provides the name of the directory along with the path.

- callback: it is the function called at the end of the execution of the readdir and 
it takes two parameters, The first one is an `error` and the second one is an `files`: 
used to store the array of the files that are present inside the directory at the given path.

Refer below example to learn the usage of the `readdir` :

```js
// Example

// importing required modules :
const fs = require("fs");
const path = require("path");

// defining the path of the directory to pathToFile variable. here we are choosing the current working directory.

let pathToFile = __dirname;

// let pathToFile = "home/mayank_banga";  // just an another way to define path.

// calling readdir() function
fs.readdir(pathToFile, (error, files) => {
  if (error) {
    // checking whether any error occurs while reading directory
    throw error; // if an error occurs then throw that error
  } else {
    console.log(files); // if error did not occur the print the list of files.
  }
});

// Assuming that we have only two files (konfinity.txt, manual.txt) inside our current working directory then the output should look something like this :

["konfinity.txt", "manual.txt"];
```
