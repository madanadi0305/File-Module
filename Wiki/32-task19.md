# FS Module Exercise 19

Write a Javascript program that copies the content of one file to another file.

Your task is to create a function that takes two parameters, first is the source file name and second is the destination file name and returns a promise. Import your task04.js and use it inside the function to ensure whether the destination file exists or not. If the destination file does not exist then your function should create the file with that name given and copy the data of source file to it and resolves a message "Content copied successfully". and If the file exists then it should reject with the message "cannot copy data : File exists".

Hint :

- Copy content from **task04.js** file from previous **task04** issue. 
- Open file named: **task19.js** and start coding inside it
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameters
- Use require() to import your **task04**.
- Use fs.copyFile to write the content to the file
- return the promise as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
