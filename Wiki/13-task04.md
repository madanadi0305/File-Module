# FS Module Exercise 4

Write a Javascript program to Check whether the file exists or not.

Your task is to create a javascript function that takes one parameter i.e. filename with its path and return a promise which resolves a message "File exists" if file exists and rejects with a message "File does not exist" if the file does not exist.

Hints :

- Open file named `task04.js` and start coding inside it.
- Create a parameterized function with mentioned parameter.
- Use fs.access inside it.
- return a promise inside the function as mentioned
- Export your function using `module.exports`
