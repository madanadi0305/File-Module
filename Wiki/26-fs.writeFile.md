# fs.wrtieFile(pathToFile, data, callback)

fs.writeFile is an asynchronous function used to write the content in the file.
it asynchronously writes data to a file, replacing the file if it already exists or creates it if the file does not exist. data can be a string or a buffer.

It takes three parameters that are as follows :

- pathToFile : it provides the filename along with its full path, in which content is to be written

- data: data can be passed in the form of string, buffer and some other ways. Mostly used is a string.

- callback: it is the function called at the end of the execution of the readdir and it takes only one parameter which is an error.

Let us understand how to use writeFile :

```js
// Example :

// importing required modules
const path = require("path");
const fs = require("fs");

// defining path of the file whose content we want to read, let us write content to konfinityMoto.txt at current working directory itself.

let pathToFile = path.join(__dirname, "KonfinityMoto.txt");

// calling writeFile and writing "Talk is cheap, Learn to code" inside it.

fs.writeFile(pathToFile, "Talk is cheap, Learn to code", error => {
  if (error) {
    // checking whether error occured or not
    throw error; // if error occurs then throw it.
  } else {
    // if error not occured

    // print the following message

    console.log("content in file has been written");
  }
});
```
